From everything that you see going on in the picture, everything that you see happening. Well, theres's a mother standing there and washing the dishes in the sing with the water spilling. And windows open and outside the window there's a curb walk with a garden and you can see another building there. Looks like a garage or something with curtains in it and grass in the garden. And there are dishes and two cups and a sauce in the sink and she's getting her feet wet from overflow of the water from the sink. She seems to be oblivious to the fact that the sink is overflowing. She's also oblivious to the fact that her kids are stealing cookes out of the cookie jar and the kid on the stood is going to fall off the stool .He's standing out there in the cover taking cookies out of the jar and a girl about the same age. The kids are somewhere around the age of seven or nine and the mother is going to get shocked when the he tumbles and the cookie jar comes down and I think that about all.
